ooks like your `test_client.py` script successfully ran and processed the `training_set.csv` to generate `test_set.csv` with the classification results. Hereâ€™s a summary of what happened:

1. **Client Script Execution:**
   - You ran `python test_client.py training_set.csv test_set.csv`.
   - The script read `training_set.csv`, sent it to your Flask server running at `http://localhost:49200/process`.
   - After processing, it saved the output to `test_set.csv`.

2. **Server Response:**
   - The server responded with `{'output': 'test_set.csv', 'status': 'success'}`.
   - This indicates that the processing was successful (`status: success`) and the output CSV file (`test_set.csv`) was created.

3. **Output Verification:**
   - The script then loaded `test_set.csv` and printed its contents, showing the `id` and `category` columns for each classified article.

Everything seems to be working correctly based on this output. If you have any specific questions or need further assistance with this project, feel free to ask!

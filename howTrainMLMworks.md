**The `train.py` file is used to train the machine learning model on your dataset. Hereâ€™s how to run the training script and integrate it into the overall workflow:**

### 1. Prepare Your Training Data

Ensure your training data is in a CSV file named `training_data.csv` with the following format:

```csv
id,category,title,body
5639,International_Finance,How Has Devaluation of the Yuan Impacted Global Currencies? - Market Realist,"How Has the Devaluation of the Yuan Impacted Global Markets? (Part 1 of 6)
...
```

### 2. Train the Model

Create the `train.py` script with the following content to train the model:

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
import pickle

# Load the training data
training_data = pd.read_csv('training_data.csv')

# Prepare the features and labels
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=1000)
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(training_data['body'])
label_encoder = LabelEncoder()
y = label_encoder.fit_transform(training_data['category'])

# Train the classifier
classifier = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100)
classifier.fit(X, y)

# Save the trained model, vectorizer, and label encoder to disk
with open('financial_text_classifier.pkl', 'wb') as model_file:
    pickle.dump(classifier, model_file)
with open('financial_text_vectorizer.pkl', 'wb') as vectorizer_file:
    pickle.dump(vectorizer, vectorizer_file)
with open('financial_text_encoder.pkl', 'wb') as encoder_file:
    pickle.dump(label_encoder, encoder_file)

print("Model training completed and files saved.")
```

### 3. Run the Training Script

Execute the training script to train the model and save the necessary files:

```sh
python train.py
```

### 4. Verify the Trained Model

After running `train.py`, ensure that the following files are created in your project directory:
- `financial_text_classifier.pkl`
- `financial_text_vectorizer.pkl`
- `financial_text_encoder.pkl`

### 5. Continue with the Previous Steps

Once the model is trained and the necessary files are saved, you can follow the steps outlined previously to:
1. Start the Flask server using `classify_financial_articles.py`.
2. Send a POST request to classify articles.
3. Verify the output using `verify_output.py`.

### Summary of Steps

1. **Prepare Training Data**: Ensure your data is in `training_data.csv`.
2. **Train the Model**: Run `train.py` to train the model and save the required files.
3. **Start Flask Server**: Run `classify_financial_articles.py` to start the server.
4. **Classify Articles**: Use `curl` or a similar tool to send a POST request to the server.
5. **Verify Output**: Check the `output.csv` file and print the results using `verify_output.py`.
